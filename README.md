# schpec

Schpec is a utility library for clojure.spec.

It is currently empty but is intended to be a home for all manner of
things, such as:

- common specs
- generators related to specs
- helper functions/macros for defining specs
- whatever other feature you miss from
  [plumatic/schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema)
- etc.

## Contributing

Pull requests! I welcome anything related to clojure.spec that is at
least half-baked. Sufficiently weird things will be relegated to
sufficiently obscure namespaces.
