# schpec

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gfredericks/schpec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gfredericks/schpec)

Schpec is a utility library for clojure.spec.

## Obtention

Note that schpec will not attempt to be stable until clojure.spec is stable.

``` clojure
[com.gfredericks/schpec "0.1.2"]
```

## Things it has

In the `com.gfredericks.schpec` namespace:

- `xor`: like `s/or` but values can only match exactly one spec
- `excl-keys`: like `s/keys`, but does not allow extra keys
- `alias`: like `clojure.core/alias`, but can alias to non-existing namespaces

### `com.gfredericks.schpec.defn+spec/defn`

A variant of `defn` that allows annotating args with specs, and
overloading function clauses with specs. Tries each clause in order.

E.g.,

``` clojure
(defn+spec/defn thomas
  ([a :- integer?, b :- boolean?]
   [:int-and-bool a b])
  ([a b]
   [:any-two-args a b])
  ([a b c :- integer? d & more]
   [:four-args-1-int+varargs a b c d "here's the varargs ->" more])
  ([a b c d]
   [:any-four-args a b c d]))
```

## Things it could have if it had them

It is currently empty but is intended to be a home for all manner of
things, such as:

- other common specs
- generators related to specs
- other helper functions/macros for defining specs
- whatever other feature you miss from
  [plumatic/schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema)
- etc.

## Contributing

Pull requests! I welcome anything related to clojure.spec that is at
least half-baked. Sufficiently weird things will be relegated to
sufficiently obscure namespaces.
